Chandler: Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya? (Phone rings.� Chandler answers using the speaker phone.)
Chandler: Chandler Bing.
Joey: Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant? (She frowns.� Chandler picks up the hand set.)
Chandler: What's up Joe?
Joey: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Chandler: Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Joey: No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to    be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!
Chandler: Courtside?� Oh my God.
Joey: Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with    his knee.
Chandler: That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know. (Chandler hangs up and calls Monica who is reading a book on their sofa as    the phone rings.)
Monica: Hello?
Chandler: Joey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and    me tomorrow night.
Monica: Really?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.�    If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
Chandler: But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right    in fr. . . (Pause)� That's not the way to convince you.
Monica: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You    can't go to the game.� You have to spend time with me."� So, if you could just    realize it on your own . . .
Chandler: I know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to    figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.
Monica: Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him    that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that    what little time we have is precious.
Chandler: Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something. [ OPENING CREDITS ] [Scene
Ross: Wow!� (pause)� Wow, You look . . . uh . . .�� It's just, ah . . .�� That    dress . . . uh . . .�
Rachel: Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Ross: Well, well, they're good.� It's been a while since I've seen you like    this.� You, you clean up good.
Rachel: Oh well, well thank you.� (She laughs.� He stares for a moment.)� Okay,    stop.� Stop looking at me like that.� The last time that happened, (points    to Ross) that happened.� (points to Emma.)
Ross: Oh right, right.� (They pause and exchange a glance. Then, Ross looks    away.)� So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night    away from Emma?
Rachel: Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank    you for watching the baby, by the way.
Ross: Oh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
Rachel: Phoebe's Mike?
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: I didn't know you guys hung out.
Ross: We don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know,    maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
Rachel: Oh that's so
Ross: I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.�    He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some    experience in that area. (Rachel nods.� There is a knock on the door.)
Rachel: Yeah. (Phoebe and Mike enter.)
Phoebe: Hi
Rachel: Hey.
Phoebe: (spotting Rachel's dress) Oooh.� Girl's night out indeed.
Rachel: (to Ross) Ok.� So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,    but if you need anything Ross . . .
Ross: Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.
Rachel: Okay.� You too.� And I hope you score.� (to Mike) Bye.
Ross: So . . .� Welcome.
Ross: I got bottled breast milk.
Ross: Okay.� (They sit.)� So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
Ross: You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
Ross: No.
Ross: Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe    said you . . . You've been divorced?
Ross: (pause) That's okay.� We'll talk about (pause) something else.� (They    pause.� They drink.)
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Ah?� (Mike nods.� Another pause.)� Well, he and I would probably have    a lot to talk about. [Scene
Monica: Hi.
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Welcome home.
Chandler: (Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to    Monica.)� Oh well, look at you.
Monica: Yeah.� What do you think?
Chandler: Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the    same thing underneath.� So . . .
Monica: Oh.
Chandler: See what I mean . . . (They kiss.) (There is a loud thud at the door.)
Joey: Hey!� How come the door's locked?
Monica: Just a second.
Chandler: (hushed) No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.
Monica: Why not?
Chandler: Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks    game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
Monica: So, you lied to him?
Chandler: Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.�    (pause)� Except with you.
Joey: Hey!� Open the door.� What's going on?� (He knocks.) (Monica goes to the door.� Chandler slides behind it as she opens it slightly.)
Joey: What are you . ..� (He sees her in her negligee.)� Why are you dressed    like that?
Monica: Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple    of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.
Joey: Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
Monica: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.� You know,    like, "Hi, How do I look?"� (As Chandler) "Really sexy.� Could I BE any more    turned on?"
Joey: Okay.� (pause.� He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)�    Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Monica: Because. . .� one of them is for you. (Monica turns to get the wine.� Chandler peeps through the peephole.� Joey,    seeing something, peeps back.� Chandler ducks.� Monica returns with two glasses    of wine.� She gives one to Joey.)
Monica: Cheers.� (She clinks his glass and pulls back.)� Okay, buh-bye.� (She    closes the door.)
Chandler: You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction    myself.� (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and    wiggles it.)� Hi ya.
Monica: You might want to keep practicing.
Chandler: Yah. (Chandler's cell phone rings.� He looks at it.)
Chandler: It's Joey.� (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear    too.)� Hey Joe.
Joey: Dude, come home!
Chandler: What? Why?
Joey: COME . . .� HOME.
Chandler: Look I, I can't.� What's going on?
Joey: I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin'    on ya.� I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you. (Chandler and Monica look at each other.� Chandler nods.)
Joey: All right look.� (He walks to the hallway.)� If you can't come home and    deal with this, then I'm gonna.
Chandler: NO!
Joey: (outside the apartment door) I just heard him!
Chandler: (softly) Can you . . . hear him . . . now?
Joey: (listens at the door.)� No.� (pause) All right, I'm going in.
Chandler: No! Wait!
Joey: I heard him again!
Chandler: (writhes as if in agony) All right, look.� Just stay there.� I'm    coming home.
Joey: Okay.� Great.� I'll see you when you get here.� I'm gonna wait out in    the hall in case the dude comes out.
Chandler: Is that really necessary?
Joey: Absolutely.� You'd do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I    know how to keep my women satisfied. [Scene
Ross: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes    or less.� Well, how long has it been?
Ross: I do.� I do.� Although, it's actually a lager.
Ross: I don't know.� We could look it up.
Phoebe: Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around    talking about you and Ross?
Rachel: Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.
Phoebe: I know.� (sighs)�� So, what's going on with you and Ross?
Rachel: Well, um . . . I don't know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But    you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah    . . . little thing.
Phoebe: Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?
Rachel: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we    had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
Phoebe: Eye-contact?
Rachel: Mm-hmm.
Phoebe: I hope you were using protection.
Rachel: Oh.� (to Phoebe) Should we send them something back?
Phoebe: Oooh.� Let's do.� Let's send them mashed potatoes.
Rachel: No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don't do that!� That's going to make them think    they can come over here.
Phoebe: So?� What if they do?
Rachel: Well, we're not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a    b. . . baby and a Ross.
Phoebe: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.� We're just having fun.�    You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact." [Scene
Monica: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
Chandler: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating    on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� (Monica tips her head    slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")� I heard it.
Monica: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Chandler: All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.
Monica: Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
Chandler: Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait    for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got    back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy    in here.
Monica: Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?� (pause)�    I heard it. (Chandler runs to the window, opens it, starts out, but returns, casually walking    back to his chair.)
Chandler: I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Monica: Scary pigeon's back?
Chandler: It's huge. [Scene
Rachel: Oh my God.� I can't believe you live in that building.� My grandmother    lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells    like chicken?� Looks like a potato.
Rachel: That's my bubby!
Phoebe: Yeah. . . I'm sorry.� We weren't really looking for anything to happen    with you guys.� I, I have a boyfriend.
Rachel: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.� But    um. . .
Rachel: (pause) I'm sorry, no.
Rachel: Oh sure.� (She pulls a business card from her purse and writes on it.)
Phoebe: (Reading the card.) Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
Rachel: Great.
Phoebe: Bye. (The guys leave.) Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma    are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
Rachel: I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.
Phoebe: What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don't you want to talk to    Ross about it?
Rachel: No.� No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.� "Hey    Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
Rachel: (lowers voice to imitate Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat.)� "Me too."
Rachel: (as herself) "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about    it."
Rachel: (as Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat twice.) "Me neither." (Clears throat    again.)
Rachel: (as herself) "Well, should we just continue to live together and not    really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
Rachel: (as Ross) "Yeah.� That works for me." (Clears throat twice more.)
Phoebe: Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.
Rachel: Oh, thanks.
Phoebe: But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
Rachel: (whining) Wha. . . hey!
Phoebe: (pointing) Better!
Rachel: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments    with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.
Phoebe: Really?� You're moving on from Ross?
Rachel: I don't know.� Do I have to decide right now?
Phoebe: Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.�    Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
Rachel: Oh God, Ross.� Ross is going to pick up the phone.� Oh, I have to get    my number back.� (She turns to find Bill, but they have gone.)� Oh my God.�    He's gone.
Phoebe: (imitating Rachel) "Oh, I have to get my number back.� Oh my God.�    He's gone."� (smiles) Dead on. [Scene
Ross: So soon?
Ross: Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
Ross: Ah yeah.� Good times. (Mike leaves.� Ross closes the door behind him.)
Phoebe: (calling from the bar on her cell phone.) Hey, Mike, it's me.� Listen,    is um, is Ross near you?
Phoebe: Well, you have to go back in.
Phoebe: I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,    um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all    his calls.
Phoebe: (to Rachel) He says he can't do that.
Rachel: Oh give me , , ,� (Phoebe gives Rachel the phone.)� Hi, Mike?� Hi.�    Listen.� I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?� If you do this I .    . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.� Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
Phoebe: All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.)� Hello?� Hi.� I'm sorry    about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
Phoebe: (knowingly chuckles) Oh, Mike.� Bye. (Mike knocks on Ross's door.� Ross opens it.)
Ross: Uh, hi.
Ross: (putting his arm up with his hand on the door frame.)� Why?� (He starts    to lower his arm.)
Ross: (whining) But you left. [Scene
Joey: Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three    hour flight.
Chandler: (pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference. (Joey thinks a moment. Then, he nods.� Joey follows Chandler into the apartment.)
Monica: (gasp) Chandler!� You're home!
Chandler: That's right.� You're husband's home.� So, now the sex can stop. (Joey gives him and odd look.� Monica gives a similar look.)
Monica: What are you saying?
Chandler: Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Monica: There's no man in here.� How dare you accuse me of that.� (She slaps    Chandler.)
Joey: All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend    take a look around, huh?� (He checks the bathroom shaking the bat.� Then he    proceeds to their bedroom.)� Bwa-ah-ah! (Thudding sounds can be heard from the bedroom.)
Chandler: (To Monica) What is he doing?
Monica: (smiling) I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
Joey: (emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
Chandler: All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.
Joey: (sniffing the air and then Monica.)� Why do I smell men's cologne?
Monica: (sniffing Joey) I think that's you.
Joey: (sniffs his shirt.)� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Chandler: There's nobody here Joe.
Joey: I guess not.
Monica: I can't believe you thought I was cheating.� (pointing at Joey) You    own me an apology.
Joey: Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.
Monica: (suddenly starts issuing him out) Ah, it's an honest mistake.� It could    happen to anyone.� All right, see ya.
Joey: (spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it) Whoa,    whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how    did your suitcase beat you here?
Chandler: (thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you    can't put that in the closet? [Scene
Ross: Maybe you should look up "fascinating." (Phone rings.)
Ross: (takes the phone, but speaks to Mike) I don't understand what just happened    here. [Scene
Joey: What's going on?
Chandler: I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend    the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.
Joey: What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be    with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."� (He strikes himself in    the head with the bat.� He stands dazed for a moment.)
Monica: Joey?
Joey: Yeah?� (His eyes bug out.)
Monica: I don't know what to say.� We shouldn't have lied to you.
Chandler: Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to    you?
Joey: (pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know    you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a    bump on the head.
Chandler: I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with    Monica.
Joey: All right.
Monica: (taps chandler on the arm) You can go.
Chandler: What?
Monica: You should go to the game.� It's okay.� I want you to.
Chandler: Really?� You're gonna be okay?
Monica: Yeah, I'll be fine.� You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the    art of seduction.
Chandler: You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
Monica: It's gonna be so hot!� (She kisses him.)
Chandler: Okay, bye.
Monica: Have fun.
Joey: Thanks.� (Joey and Chandler exit to the hall.� Joey pulls out the tickets    and hands one to Chandler.)� Here's your ticket.
Chandler: Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want    you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Joey: Thanks man. (Chandler heads toward the stairs, but makes a turn back to his apartment while    looking at the ticket.)
Joey: Where are you going?
Chandler: Game's tomorrow night Joe. (Chandler goes into the apartment, while Joey checks his ticket and is embarrassed    by his stupid mistake.) [Scene

Ross: Hello.� (listens)� Ah, no, she's not here right now.� Can I take a message?�    (grabs a pad and pen)� Bill from the bar?� (writes)� Okay, "Bill from the bar."�    I'll make sure she gets your number. (He hangs up the phone and tears the note off the pad.� Then, he stops and    re-reads it.� Rachel enters.)
Rachel: Aaah.� (She goes to tend Emma.)
Ross: So, ah . . . So, how was it?�� Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have    a good time?
Rachel: Oh, it was so much fun.� It felt so good to be out.
