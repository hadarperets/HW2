Ross: (laughs) No
Ross: Damn super cuts!
Ross: oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot   look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.
Ross: yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never   having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun,   a wonderful person please don't blow her off.
Ross: well then I didn't need to bother you or the four   other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Ross: of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship   I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Ross: yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about   to say Vis-ï¿½-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship   since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.
Ross: WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!  [Scene

Chandler: DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB!
Monica: (smiles)
Monica:
Chandler: everything's great, just watching some regular   television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what   he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking   Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
Monica:
Chandler: Ok honey. that was close.  -Cut to Rachel (Phone ringing)
Rachel: Hello
Monica:
Rachel: Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know   guys do that.

Rachel: well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he   was doing?
Monica:
Rachel: man sharks. I always knew there was something weird   about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Monica:
Rachel: Ah! You know what honey guys are just different,   they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who   wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that   he unfroze from a block of ice.
Monica:
Rachel: yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Joey: (enters) Hey
Rachel: (sits down) Hi
Joey: listen to this... I went out with this girl last night   and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.  (Monica makes a strange face and sits down)
Rachel: so basically you've slept with all the woman in   New York and now you're just going around again.
Joey: well that's not even the weird part. I don't think   she remembered sleeping with me.
Monica:
Joey: yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am   very memorable, you guys know.
Rachel: what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
Joey: and who's fault is that.
Monica:
Joey: HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes   when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN   MOST!
Monica:
Rachel: yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember   who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
Joey: Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again   and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) OH SALT BLOATY!
Monica:
Joey: What?

Ross: YAY! (He continues the happiness with her by dancing   around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
Phoebe: What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
Ross: oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there   to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended   up telling him that.
Phoebe: WHAT!
Ross: umm. that you had a six year long relationship with   a guy named Vicrum.
Phoebe: WHAT! WHY?
Ross: well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in   a serious relationship.
Phoebe: (Walks towards Ross) If you hadn't just had a baby   with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your   danglers RIGHT NOW!
Ross: well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know   a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he   used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)
Phoebe: I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross,   No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Ross: Good yeah just be honest with him.
Phoebe: yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't   been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a   real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will   and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll   be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh   (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)
Ross: I'll get it
Phoebe: ok
Phoebe: Uh huh yeah (stands up) there's just something umm,   there's something you should know (Pause) Vicrum just called.  [Scene
Joey: Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Joey: How could you not remember that we slept together?
Joey: I dunno!
Joey: come on, come on, search your brain all right. it   was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had   sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
Joey: my god woman! How many people do you have to had been   with not to remember any of this?  Hayley's
Joey: Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember   me Hey! I still got it. (Turns back to Hayley) so were good. (She just glares   at him) I'll let myself out.  [Scene
Phoebe: .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time   you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
Phoebe: yeah well (pause) yeah you know Emma's birth certificate   might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Phoebe: I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You   know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: ok I can't do this.
Phoebe: well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because   I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with   a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's   too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close   my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses   her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.
Phoebe: so you don't think I'm a total freak
Phoebe: I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you   kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls   back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Ross: (They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it   up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.  [Scene
Chandler: Hi honey I'm home!
Monica:
Chandler: oh it was great.
Monica:
Chandler: well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because   it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Monica:
Chandler: (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching   a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Monica:
Chandler: no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie   that's all.
Monica:
Chandler: does what always have to be sharks.
Monica:
Chandler: What's going on?
Monica:
Chandler: let ME be a part of this!
Monica:
Chandler: no they don't
Monica:
Chandler: OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel,   I was just watching regular porn
Monica:
Chandler: yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American   action.
Monica:
Chandler: You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really   you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you   find the strength and understanding over something like that.
Monica:
Joey: (looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily I would talk   to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with   her?
Phoebe: you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your     whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious     relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you     go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience     never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
Joey: your right! I love my life! (He gets up to go and   speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) I actually did sleep with   her.
